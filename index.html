            <br> <h2>Our Roots</h2><br>
			<p class="lead text-muted">Born in Cairns, Jamie’s family and ancestors were Bama of Bulgan Warra (Kings Plain, South of Cooktown), which is now of the greater Kuku-Yalanji country, and because of this Jamie spent much of his childhood being raised throughout Cape York.
                    <br><br>
                Throughout the years, Jamie was guided by his parents and grandparents and quickly learnt what was required to succeed in the highly demanding environment that was the Cape. Aiding his growth, elders within the family instilled values of respect and integrity. Jamie was taught to work hard for things in life and has since taken responsibility upon himself to instil these values into a new working generation.
                    <br><br>
                Starting out his career in a local government shire – Mareeba Shire Council which is also within the Kuku-Yalanji nation, Jamie has over a decade of civil construction experience and has since worked for global companies down to local leaders within the industry.
                    <br><br>
                Jamie has been an integral part of successful management teams for major projects valued up to $173million and for a multitude of minor contracts that improved living standards for people in both remote and city environments. The clients for these projects included the Cook Shire, Torres Shire Council and the Department of Transport and Main Roads. Jamie has successfully managed workforces of up to 120 employees and subcontractors on projects that were not only within the media spotlight and with major political influence but also required strong community engagement with targets that were achieved for indigenous employment and creation of opportunities.</p>
